Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel."," "

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX] and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. [XXX] were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November [XXX], 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/[XXX]/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error."," "
