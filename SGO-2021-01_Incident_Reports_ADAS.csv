The vehicle was decelerating in heavy traffic on northbound [XXX] in Phoenix, AZ, and, while traveling at approximately 7mph, was rear-ended by a Chevrolet Malibu that was traveling at a high rate of speed.  The impact caused front end damage to the Malibu, and rear end damage to the Audi, and also pushed the Audi into a BMW Z4, causing minor front end damage to the Audi, and minor rear end damage to the BMW.  EDR data retrieved from the Audi indicate that ADAS systems were not active at the time that it was rear-ended by the Chevrolet.  The driver of the Audi was belted, and the airbag did not deploy.  There were no injuries, but the damage to the Audi was severe enough that towaway was necessary.  This incident was part of a multi-car collision, involving five vehicles in total the Audi came into contact with two of those vehicles (Chevrolet and BMW).  Because the EDR data indicates that ADAS systems were not active at the time of the incident and the Audi vehicle appears to have performed as designed, VWGoA has no plans for further investigation and considers this matter closed."," "

Before the crash, the vehicle was proceeding straight on a highway road with Super Cruise engaged at 85 mph at 11:06:40.  Supercruise was disabled at 11:08:20 when the driver applied the brakes as indicated by telematic data. The crash occured at 11:08:25. The driver reported to OnStar that the vehicle struck a deer.  Super Cruise was not active at the time of the crash. After the Crash, OnStar Emergency contacted the driver and found out the driver was alert and responsive.  The advisor called 911, however, there was no claim of injury reported. Telematics data indicates that the driver was belted at the time of the crash and the driver's airbag deployed. The driver reported to Onstar that he cut the steering wheel airbag to drive the vehicle to the shoulder of the highway.  There is no updated information for the 10-day report."," "

The customer did indicate the Highway Drive Assist mode was on.  The customer alleges that the vehicle left the lane of travel when driving a steep curved road, initiating a crash.  Hyundai notes that the ODD of the Highway Drive Assist system is limited by certain environmental factors, such as weather and curvatures in the path of travel, requiring the driver to remain engaged at all times while operating the vehicle.  Hyundai is attempting to gather additional details on the incident for a possible vehicle inspection. 
*10-Day Update*
Hyundai is attempting to inspect the incident vehicle and download the EDR report for further analysis.
*Monthly Update #1*
Hyundai inspected the vehicle on October [XXX], 2021. The inspection and associated EDR report is currently under review.  The results and assessment will be provided in the next monthly update and in the next monthly ""deep dive"" discussion with ODI.
*Monthly Update #2 - Final assessment*
Hyundai reviewed the traffic report and deduced that HDA could not have been engaged during the incident. HDA is only available for approved highways such as federal interstates. Hyundai also reviewed the EDR report and confirmed the driver entered the turn with Smart Cruise Control (""SCC"") engaged at a set speed of 80 mph. The accelerator pedal was depressed throughout the event. The brake pedal was never depressed. Lane Following Assist (""LFA"") engagement could not be confirmed however, a manual steering maneuver was performed approximately 2 seconds prior to the incident and the ESC engaged, indicating a vehicle slip.  Hyundai deduced that the operator could have entered the turn at a high speed, realizing that the vehicle may not be able steer itself through the curve, and performed a significant steering maneuver in an attempt to center the vehicle within the lane, causing the vehicle to lose control. 
Hyundai notes that the HDA/LFA/SCC systems are not Level 2+ systems and are not designed nor marketed to provide complete ""hands-free"" driving to the operator. Drivers must be ready at all times with their hands on the wheel to insert themselves into a manual driving task. Hyundai has implemented driver attention warning systems that alert drivers up to 3 consecutive times if hands are not detected on the steering wheel for a brief period of time."," "

The customer alleged being in an accident, said thanks for saving his life, but also alleged that the lane trace assist failed. Customer stated that he was using cruise control at the time of the accident and does not remember the cruise control speed (but mentioned driving at the speed limit or 10% over the speed limit during the call). The customer alleged that there was sudden down pour of rain and should not have had the cruise control on, and could have been driving safer, but expected the lane trace to have performed better. The customer stated he was using his thumb to decrease the cruise control speed and believes he drove over a large puddle of water and possibly a pothole. The customer also stated that lanes were not detected and the lane tracing assist malfunctioned, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and drift. He reported that the vehicle hit 2-7 trees before coming to a stop. He stated the driver airbag deployed, saving his life, and the driver side seat airbag and driver curtain shield airbags also deployed. He alleges sustaining whiplash, bruising lower abdomen, left knee contusion, cut on left forearm and psychologic stress from the incident. He declined to go to the hospital at the time of the crash but did get a CT scan two days after the crash, which he stated revealed no brain injuries.This update report is being submitted as part of SGO 2021-01 - Request 1 in which each reporting entity must submit ""an updated Incident Report on the tenth (10th) calendar day after receipt of notice"".

The customer alleged being in an accident, said thanks for saving his life, but also alleged that the lane trace assist failed. Customer stated that he was using cruise control at the time of the accident and does not remember the cruise control speed (but mentioned driving at the speed limit or 10% over the speed limit during the call). The customer alleged that there was sudden down pour of rain and should not have had the cruise control on, and could have been driving safer, but expected the lane trace to have performed better. The customer stated he was using his thumb to decrease the cruise control speed and believes he drove over a large puddle of water and possibly a pothole. The customer also stated that lanes were not detected and the lane tracing assist malfunctioned, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and drift. He reported that the vehicle hit 2-7 trees before coming to a stop. He stated the driver airbag deployed, saving his life, and the driver side seat airbag and driver curtain shield airbags also deployed. He alleges sustaining whiplash, bruising lower abdomen, left knee contusion, cut on left forearm and psychologic stress from the incident. He declined to go to the hospital at the time of the crash but did get a CT scan two days after the crash, which he stated revealed no brain injuries."," "
